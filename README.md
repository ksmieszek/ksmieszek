#### Hi ğŸ‘‹ğŸ˜„

My name is Karol Åšmieszek, I live near KrakÃ³w. I recently graduated computer science at the WSB-NLU University.

The university forced me to learn many new technologies and languages but we mainly programed in C# and use its ecosystem. I wasnâ€™t particularly interested in that but it gave me a better understanding of how the applications work as a whole.

I'm interested in the newest web technologies which I learn on my own.
